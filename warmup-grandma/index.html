Write a Deaf Grandma program.

Whatever you say to grandma (whatever you type in), she should respond with

HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!
unless you shout it (type in all capitals).

If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) and yells back

NO, NOT SINCE 1938!
To make your program really believable, have grandma shout a different year each time; maybe any year at random between 1930 and 1950.

You can't stop talking to grandma until you shout BYE (when you shout bye the programme should exit)
